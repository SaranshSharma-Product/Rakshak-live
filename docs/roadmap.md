# Rakshak Live – Roadmap

> This roadmap outlines the phased development and implementation plan for Rakshak Live — from MVP prototyping to national rollout.

---

## 📌 Current Stage: Ideation & Government Proposal (Q2–Q3 2025)

- ✅ PRD, vision, technical feasibility documents drafted
- ✅ Core feature map and data sensitivity analysis complete
- ✅ Repo structure and documentation finalized
- ⬜ Stakeholder briefings (MHA, MeitY, Smart City Councils)
- ⬜ UI/UX mockups prepared for app and dashboard

---

## 🚧 Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Goal:** Build a functioning MVP of Rakshak Live for pilot testing in a single city (e.g., Indore or Pune).

| Milestone                         | Timeline      |
|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Wireframes for mobile + dashboard| 1 week        |
| Android app (stream + GPS + UI)  | 2–3 weeks     |
| Backend (video chunking + storage)| 2 weeks      |
| Police dashboard (view + route)  | 2 weeks       |
| Silent witness module (IMEI/MAC) | 1 week        |
| Aadhaar KYC integration (test mode) | 1 week     |
| Final QA + UAT with mock data    | 1 week        |
| **Pilot Launch in 1 city**       | **Month 2–3** |

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Secure Gov-Infra & AI Integration

**Goal:** Move from MVP to hardened government version.

- Migrate backend and video storage to **NIC/MeghRaj cloud**
- Integrate with **UIDAI + CCTNS** via MeitY-approved API access
- Implement server-side **facial recognition using OpenCV/AWS Rekognition**
- Add **anomaly detection** (auto-flagging false alarms, misuse)
- Finalize **role-based access control** for dashboard
- Secure logs for legal & judicial handover

---

## 🌐 Phase 3: Expansion to Tier-1 Cities

**Goal:** Roll out Rakshak Live in major smart cities with district police support.

- Language support (Hindi, English, Marathi, Kannada, etc.)
- Launch control center in 5 major metros (Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, etc.)
- Auto case file generator linked to **eCourts**
- Route-based deployment analytics and response-time tracking
- Begin public awareness campaign on national TV/socials

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: National Grid (Optional Vision)

**Goal:** Create an interconnected law enforcement network that responds intelligently to live crime data across India.

- Cross-state suspect matching + alert routing
- Pattern detection across live streams (serial crimes, harassment zones)
- Smart drone integration in smart cities
- Autonomous stream escalation (high-risk alerts prioritized by AI)
- Rakshak Kiosks in public places (auto-video booths for citizens)

## ⚖️ Dependencies & Approvals Needed

| Area             | Dependency                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| Identity Match   | UIDAI, CCTNS access (Gov approval) |
| Device Logging   | DoT, telecoms (lawful interception)|
| Cloud Hosting    | NIC / MeghRaj allocation           |
| Police Ops       | State-level command center buy-in  |
| KYC Enforcement  | Aadhaar/DigiLocker integration     |

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

- ⏱  Average time between alert and police acknowledgment < 60 sec
- 🎥  % of crimes livestreamed that result in FIR with proof > 90%
- 🧍‍♂️  # of unique citizens protected by app in first 6 months > 10K
- 👮  Police response time tracking (live dashboard)
- 🧠  Suspect matches via AI > 75% precision

---

## 🏁 Final Note

Rakshak Live is not a typical tech product. It’s a public infrastructure upgrade — a digital seatbelt for citizens and a command-line for justice.

This roadmap reflects a **secure, focused, phased approach** that respects legality, privacy, and operational realism.
