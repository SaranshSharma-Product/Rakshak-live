## 🎯 Goals

* Enable instant, one-tap livestreaming from citizens to police.
* Provide contextual GPS and landmark data for precise location tracking.
* Offer police intuitive navigation and multi-responder coordination.
* Securely archive all streams with tamper-resistant government infrastructure.
* Ensure responsible usage via verified identity and abuse mitigation.
* Maintain user safety with fallback mechanisms for connectivity or device failure.
* Build trust and ease-of-use through empathetic design and clear feedback.

## 🧩 Key Features (MVP + Smart Innovations)

### 1. 📡 One-Tap Livestream Activation & User Flow

* Stream starts immediately when the victim or witness taps the app or a dedicated hardware button (e.g., power button triple-click).
* App provides real-time status feedback (streaming, location shared, police notified).
* Option for “silent mode” activation to avoid alerting assailants.

### 2. 📍 Enhanced GPS & Landmark Overlay

* Stream embeds precise GPS, street address, and multiple landmarks for rapid identification.
* The app auto-updates location in real-time, even if the user is moving.

### 3. 🛣 Dynamic Route & Multi-Responder Dashboard

* Police dashboard displays fastest route from multiple patrol units, suggesting optimal responder allocation.
* Supports push-to-join for multiple officers to join the stream simultaneously.
* Shows traffic congestion and alternative routes for responders.

### 4. 🧾 Secure, Tamper-Resistant Evidence Storage

* Video streams chunk-uploaded to NIC/MeghRaj cloud with AES-256 encryption.
* Local device cache ensures upload retries if connectivity drops.
* Immutable audit logs record access and actions for judicial integrity.

### 5. 🔒 Verified Access & Abuse Prevention

* Authentication via Aadhaar, DigiLocker, or approved government KYC.
* Misuse detection flags suspicious behavior for manual police review; no automated penalties.
* Clear user education on penalties and support in case of accidental misuse.

### 6. 📶 Connectivity & Device Failure Mitigation

* Local video buffer stores last 60 seconds to avoid data loss during brief signal loss.
* “Emergency fallback mode” sends minimal location and audio-only stream if video fails.
* Automatic police alert escalation if the stream cuts unexpectedly.

### 7. 🤝 Empathy-Centered Design

* Simple, non-intimidating UI optimized for low digital literacy users.
* Visual and audio cues confirm when help is notified.
* Integrated access to crisis helplines and mental health resources post-incident.

### 8. 🔥 Smart Prioritization & Alerting

* AI-backed alert prioritization based on location, time, and historical data to avoid overload.
* Real-time monitoring to detect repeated false alarms for focused education, not punishment.
