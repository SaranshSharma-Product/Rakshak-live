# Rakshak Live (Proposed)

**India‚Äôs First Real-Time Crime Livestream System ‚Äî Fully Operated by the Government**

Rakshak Live is a product idea for a government-controlled emergency response app that allows any verified citizen to instantly livestream a crime or threat to the nearest police authority. The app serves as India‚Äôs digital eyes on the ground ‚Äî capturing real-time video, location, and surrounding device signals, even if the phone is destroyed mid-incident.

## üö® Why This Idea Matters

India faces a critical gap between crimes being committed and law enforcement‚Äôs ability to respond in time. Victims are often silenced, evidence lost, and justice delayed. Rakshak Live aims to:

- Capture unalterable video evidence
- Alert police immediately with GPS and landmark data
- Identify suspects using facial recognition and national databases
- Log nearby devices for forensic traceability
- Preserve all evidence even if the phone is broken or stolen

## üéØ Core Concept Features

- **One-Tap Livestream to Police Control Rooms**
- **Live Location & Landmark Detection**
- **Route-to-Crime Navigation for Responding Officers**
- **AI-Based Facial Recognition (UIDAI, CCTNS ‚Äì Govt Access Only)**
- **Silent Witness Logging (IMEI, MAC Addresses of Nearby Devices)**
- **Conditional Public Broadcast via Police Social Media Handles**
- **Immutable Video Evidence Backup in NIC/MeghRaj Cloud**
- **Aadhaar-Verified Citizen Access Only**

All systems are designed to be **exclusively owned, operated, and accessed by government authorities** ‚Äî with zero involvement from private entities or third parties. Privacy and evidence integrity are legally safeguarded.
