# Rakshak Live (Proposed)

**Indiaâ€™s First Real-Time Crime Livestream System â€” Fully Operated by the Government**

Rakshak Live is a product idea for a government-controlled emergency response app that allows any verified citizen to instantly livestream a crime or threat to the nearest police authority. The app aims to serve as Indiaâ€™s digital eyes on the ground â€” capturing real-time video, location, and nearby device signals, even if the phone is destroyed mid-incident.

## ðŸš¨ Why This Idea Matters

India faces a growing gap between when a crime happens and when help arrives. Victims are often silenced, evidence lost, and justice delayed. Rakshak Live is designed to:

- Capture unalterable video evidence
- Alert police immediately with GPS + landmark data
- Help identify criminals using AI and UID-linked facial recognition
- Log nearby devices for forensic witness tracing
- Preserve everything, even if the phone is broken

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concept Features

- **One-Tap Livestream to Police**
- **Live Location & Landmark Detection**
- **Route-to-Crime Navigation for Responders**
- **AI Facial Recognition (Govt Database Access Only)**
- **Silent Witness Logging (IMEI/MAC from Nearby Phones)**
- **Conditional Public Broadcast from Police Handles**
- **Immutable Evidence Cloud Backup**

All systems are to be **owned, controlled, and moderated by government authorities only** â€” with no third-party or private sector data access.
